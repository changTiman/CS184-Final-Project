        <h2 align="middle">Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Develop a physical simulation of audio signals in the form of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubens'_tube">Rubens’ Tube</a> that outputs flame as a standing wave for specific frequencies. The simulation will take in an arbitrary audio signal and 
            actuate a physical flame system based upon the sound waves and pressure inputted.
        </p>

        <h2 align="middle">Problem Description</h2>

        <p>
            Most graphics applications are isolated from sound contained within the environment being rendered. The goal of the Rubens’ Tube simulation is to resolve this divide by a simple visual frequency response 
            to sounds that could be a part of the environment. Since the Rubens’ Tube is a purely physical system it will have to be simulated, requiring an accurate simulation of sound waves and pressure, which is 
            not typically simulated within graphical applications, although some similarities can be made to light that is also a wave. The audio signal will have to be transformed from a signal into physical inputs 
            into the system as well as pipelining the signals into a fire that is outputted from the Rubens’ Tube.
        </p>

        <p>
            To accomplish the above, we were considering dividing the audio signal into intervals and running a Fourier transform on each interval to derive the constituent frequencies. Once we have the frequencies 
            and their corresponding amplitudes, we will then be able to take frequencies above a certain threshold and determine what the height of each flame will be for that interval. 
        </p>

        <h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>

        <p>
            Goal: Create a system which converts an audio file into a visual representation in the form of a Rubens’ Tube.
        </p>

        <p>
            We aim to answer the question: what would an ideal Rubens’ Tube look like, and can that be accomplished in real time?
        </p>

        <h3>Required Deliverables</h3>

        <ol type="1">
            <li>A sequence of images generated by our program which, when put into video editing software alongside the input audio file, will result in a video of a Rubens’ Tube reacting to the audio file
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Interesting performance metric: ratio of processing time / audio file length</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>To demonstrate, we will provide a video for a pure frequency as well as a more natural audio clip</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Stretch Deliverables</h3>

        <ol type="1">
            <li>Executable file available publicly which takes any audio file as input and outputs an image sequence for said audio file</li>
            <li>Realtime rendering for incoming signal</li>
        </ol>
