        <p>
            The vision for this project began as a simulation involving fire but with additional control elements determined by audio frequencies to make a rubens tube. However, the implementation of fire turned out to be more difficult than first anticipated, so getting a working fire simulation became the priority. The fire simulation was built to run in real time using the clothsim framework provided by cs184 course staff. The project uses a physical based model integrated with OpenGL for visualization. Even this turned out to be a challenge to implement, so to meet the project deadline, the project switched to using Blender for the final simulation deliverable.
        </p>

        <h2 align="middle">Technical Approach</h2>

        <p>
            The model built on the clothsim framework, following closely to the implementation detailed in the Stanford graphics paper referenced below [Nguyen et al. 2002]. The implementation works by tracking the physical aspects of the fire, stored in a voxel grid data structure. The physical characteristics are stored in a std::vector of FireVoxel structs within the fire.h file. The fire.h struct contains the implicit surface, temperature, density, and pressure at the centers and additional fluid velocity components at each face of the FireVoxels. Additional data structures are created within the Fire struct to track the map of the voxel grid as well as which FireVoxels are part of the implicit_surface, fuel, and source respectively.
        </p>

        <p>
            The initial part of the fire consists of a blue core where the liquid fuel reacts and begins to burn. This was implemented using a level set method, with the scalar implicit surface phi, defining the sets. Phi is a scalar field defined to be positive in regions that contain fuel, zero at the reaction zone, and negative elsewhere. The motion of the reaction zone is computed for each individual voxel by taking account of the fuel velocity as well as the partial derivatives, phi_x, phi_y, and phi_z, and tracking the direction in which the reaction consumes the fuel. This movement is tracked within the function update_phi that prepares a pending_phi so as to not disturb further phi calculations within the same timestep. Additionally, as per the paper, conditioning on phi is needed to constrain phi so that magnitude of delta_phi is equal to 1. By using a queue data structure, condition_phi marches out from the implicit surface, whose set if fixed, to ensure the outer sets in the onion are conditioned properly from center-out.
        </p>

        <p>
            During the process of making our simulation system, we ran into an issue where we were observing very erratic behavior of the value fields. After some digging, we discovered that we were updating phi values that other phi calculations were relying on, thus resulting in incorrect behavior. Much like in our mesh editor project, we solved this problem by storing the value to update to first, then doing a second pass to update the actual values.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unfortunately, however, due to the complexity of the fluid dynamics involved, we found that we would not be able to meet the deadline continuing with our previous approach. Thus, we turned to working within Blender to mimic the paper’s approach to fire rendering. First, we set up an inflow circle which would correlate to the fuel injection surface described in the Stanford paper. We then defined a cube as the domain of the simulation which corresponded to the 3D voxel grid of the paper. Finally, since Blender has built-in fluid simulation abilities, we were able to utilize those to easily simulate the equations described in the paper to achieve our final results.
        </p>

        <p>
            In general, the lesson would probably be to utilize existing infrastructure as much as possible. Although having a solid understanding of the underlying simulation techniques is certainly helpful, it speaks volumes that what took us 3 weeks to fail at doing took us 1 day in Blender to achieve.
